# Eye Movement Exercise

## Description

This exercise has two eyes on the page. When the mouse cursor moves around the window of the page, the eyes follow the cursor. 

## Usage

The live page for this project can be found [here](https://vghsieh.github.io/Eye-Exercise/). Simply move the mouse cursor around the page for the eyes to follow the movement. 

## Roadmap

Future goals include adding more features to make the eyes animation appear on a monster-like figure.
